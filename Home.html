            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Khaild and I live in Poland. I'm currently studying Computer Science at UITM University.
                 My dream is to start a game company with my friends.

                I think it's going to be an exciting journey because we will be working on something we love together. 
                As a computer science student, I'm learning various skills that will be useful in developing games. 
                I'm studying programming languages, software development methodologies, database design, and algorithms. 
                Additionally, we're learning about game development topics such as game engines, graphics programming, 
                game design, and user experience.
                
                Starting a game company may not be easy, but I'm willing to work hard to make it happen. 
                We'll need to create a solid business plan, form a team with complementary skills, design 
                and prototype our game, and secure funding or investors. The game industry is highly competitive, 
                so we must have a clear vision and be determined to make it a success.
                
                Overall, I'm passionate about game development and excited about my future in the industry. 
                With dedication and hard work, I'm confident that my friends and I can achieve our goal of starting
                 a game company together.</p>
